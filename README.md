# Crawler

## Introduction

We needed a crawler to find files on our website, which are not of the "usual pictures, slides and office" file types. Everything that is not "usual" and might create "problems", should be found and put on a list for review. This is exactly what this crawler does.

Special thanks to [Johannes Lorenz](https://jolorenz.wordpress.com/2014/08/11/create-a-webcrawler-with-less-than-100-lines-of-code/ "Link to original code") for allowing to reuse his code.

## Usage
